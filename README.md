# Registration reservation system
This project is the collective work of the senior Computer Science developers from Ouachita Baptist University. The objective of this project is to produce a registration reservation platform for meetings between professor and student, as opposed to signing up on paper.

# Environment Setup

After cloning the repo, some prerequisites must be installed.
1. Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager).
2. Install [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html)
3. Install several node package dependencies
    * [sqlite3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sqlite3) -- `npm install sqlite3`
    * [express](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html) -- `npm install express`
    * [ejs](https://ejs.co/) -- `npm install ejs`

# To run

To run, from the root of the project, run `nodemon frontend/server.js`.  It will start
the node webserver on port 3000, by default.  At this point, a browser should be
able to connect with [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).

## Project Context
This project was originally developed as a collaborative team effort. This repository represents my personal version of the project, including documentation and my individual contributions. My contributions include refactoring the original codebase into modular, maintainable components and developing an administrative interface for managing the system.
